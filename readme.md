# Disclaimer :

### Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a DICK !

ðŸ“Œ Code is provided with no warranty.

ðŸ“Œ If you use code, calling it your own would make you a ROYAL DICK.

ðŸ“Œ Alternatively, even just a comment giving attribution would be OK.

ðŸ“Œ Being a DICK includes just copying the original work and changing the name.

ðŸ“Œ Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a DICK.

ðŸ“Œ Modifying the original work to contain harmful content. That would make you a PROPER DICK.

ðŸ“Œ Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY DICK, fix the problem yourself.

ðŸ“Œ Only a DICK would make loads off this work and not give the original work's creator(s) a bit of credit/support.

ðŸ“Œ If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love.
